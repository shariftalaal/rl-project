Welcome to our repository for the Reinforcement Learning Coursework!

There exists, at the time of writing this file, one jupyter notebook file and one GIF.

In order to run the code, you will need an older version of Python, plus the packages required. The exact details can be found in the notebook.

If you have any questions, please send them on the group chat.

Good luck...
